# rbcovarion

### Description

An attempt at a few basic working examples of using the Covarion model in RevBayes. 

This repo will be updated more regularly, and broken more often. Once a stable copy is working it'll be available in the the main [RevBayes tutorials](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes_tutorial) repo.
